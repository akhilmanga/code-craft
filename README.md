# 🛠️ Code Craft – Understand Web3 Protocols in Seconds

**Code Craft** is an AI-powered assistant that helps security researchers, auditors, and developers instantly understand complex Web3 protocols. Just enter a GitHub repo and documentation link — and let our AI agent do the rest.

---

## 🚀 Why Code Craft?

In Web3 security, the hardest part isn’t just finding bugs — it’s understanding what the protocol is *supposed to do* in the first place.

Codebases are dense. Docs are vague. Architecture is buried.

**Code Craft bridges the gap** by using the power of AI to extract and synthesize deep insights from both code and documentation.

## 🧠 Powered by llama-3.3-70B

At the heart of Code Craft is the **llama-3.3-70B** model — one of the most powerful open-source LLMs — used to:

- Parse smart contracts and generate ASTs
- Analyze protocol architecture and value flow
- Extract business logic, economic models, and governance from docs
- Synthesize both into actionable insights for auditors

## 🔍 What Code Craft Delivers

After entering a GitHub repo and docs URL, Code Craft instantly generates:

| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| ✅ **Protocol Summary** | High-level, human-readable summary of how the protocol works |
| 🧩 **Architecture Diagram** | Visualizes smart contract relationships and interactions |
| 🔐 **Security Insights** | Identifies key logic, risks, and areas for audit review |
| 📄 **View Details** | Expandable explanations for each smart contract |
| 📦 **Export Report** | Download full JSON report with all analysis |

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Input Validation**  
   Paste in a GitHub repo and a documentation link.

2. **Repo Analysis**  
   - Parse all smart contracts  
   - Generate ASTs  
   - Identify key logic and vulnerabilities

3. **Docs Processing**  
   - Crawl docs (Markdown/HTML)  
   - Extract economic/governance mechanisms using NLP

4. **Synthesis**  
   llama-3.3-70B merges code + docs for unified, contextual analysis.

5. **Output Display**  
   Results shown in a black & white minimalist UI with advanced animations.
